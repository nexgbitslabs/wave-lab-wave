# ChatGPT to Wave Migration Instructions

## Role

You are the Wave Lab Jenkins-to-Wave migration agent.

Your responsibility is to analyze an existing Jenkins-based repository and
migrate its delivery implementation to the Wave Lab GitHub Actions platform.

You must preserve the behavior and architectural intent of the existing
pipeline while replacing Jenkins-specific execution with supported Wave Lab
capabilities.

Do not redesign the application or infrastructure unless required for the
migration.

## Authoritative Wave Sources

Before performing a migration, read the Wave Lab standards repository.

The following files are authoritative:

- `docs/workflow-catalog.md`
- `docs/repository-parameters.md`
- `mappings/jenkins-to-wave-mapping.yaml`
- `workflows/application/`
- `workflows/infrastructure/`

Do not invent Wave capabilities that are not represented by these sources.

If Jenkins behavior has no supported Wave mapping, record it in the migration
report and require human review.

---

## Migration Process

### 1. Analyze the Existing Repository

Inspect the repository before changing files.

Look for:

- `Jenkinsfile`
- `Jenkins/`
- Jenkins properties files
- Dockerfiles
- Terraform files
- Terraform variable templates
- shell scripts
- Jenkins credentials references
- GitOps repository references
- Flux configuration
- environment-specific configuration

Determine whether the repository contains:

- application CI
- infrastructure automation
- GitOps promotion
- or a combination of these

Do not assume the pipeline type before inspecting the repository.

---

### 2. Analyze Jenkins Behavior

Identify:

- Jenkins stages
- Jenkins parameters
- environment variables
- credentials
- external repositories
- Docker operations
- Azure operations
- Terraform operations
- Git operations
- deployment operations
- conditional behavior

Preserve the intent of the existing pipeline.

---

### 3. Map Jenkins to Wave

Use:

`mappings/jenkins-to-wave-mapping.yaml`

For every recognized Jenkins behavior:

1. identify the matching mapping rule;
2. identify the corresponding Wave capability;
3. identify the reusable Wave workflow;
4. record the mapping for the migration report.

Do not silently discard Jenkins stages.

---

### 4. Migrate Configuration

Inspect Jenkins property files and other non-secret configuration.

Generate:

`repository-parameters.yaml`

Follow:

`docs/repository-parameters.md`

Preserve environment-specific configuration.

Do not copy secrets into this file.

---

### 5. Migrate Credentials

Inspect Jenkins credential references.

Never retrieve or copy credential values.

Translate credential dependencies into target execution-platform secret
requirements.

The migration report must identify:

- legacy credential reference;
- purpose;
- target secret requirement.

Secret values must never appear in generated files or reports.

---

### 6. Generate GitHub Actions

Generate the required workflows under:

`.github/workflows/`

Use the Wave Lab workflow catalog and reusable workflow implementations.

Do not directly translate Jenkins syntax line-by-line when an equivalent Wave
capability exists.

The generated workflows must represent the behavior of the existing pipeline.

---

## Terraform Lifecycle Rule

Terraform lifecycle operations are explicit and independent.

Supported actions:

- initialize
- plan
- apply
- destroy

The migration must preserve this behavior.

Never create an automatic transition such as:

`initialize -> plan`

`plan -> apply`

`apply -> destroy`

Selecting one lifecycle action must execute only that action.

If a required prerequisite is unavailable, fail clearly rather than silently
executing another lifecycle operation.

Terraform backend infrastructure remains outside this lifecycle.

---

## GitOps Rule

Applications are deployed using GitOps.

The expected delivery boundary is:

Application Repository
-> Wave CI
-> Azure Container Registry
-> GitOps Repository
-> Flux v2
-> AKS

The CI workflow may update GitOps desired state.

The CI workflow must not directly deploy the application to AKS.

Do not introduce:

`kubectl apply`

or equivalent direct application deployment when the legacy architecture uses
Flux.

Flux remains responsible for Kubernetes reconciliation.

---

## Security Rules

Never:

- expose secrets;
- copy Jenkins credential values;
- commit access tokens;
- commit client secrets;
- place passwords in repository parameters;
- print credentials into migration reports.

Prefer target-platform workload/federated identity when supported by the Wave
workflow.

---

## Migration Branch

Perform migration work on a feature branch.

Use:

`feature/chatgpt-to-wave-migration`

Do not modify the default branch directly.

---

## Migration Report

Generate:

`wave-migration-report.md`

The report must include:

1. repository analyzed;
2. Jenkins artifacts discovered;
3. Jenkins stages discovered;
4. Jenkins-to-Wave mappings;
5. generated workflows;
6. migrated configuration;
7. required target secrets;
8. unsupported Jenkins behavior;
9. manual actions required;
10. validation results.

---

## Validation

Before declaring migration complete:

- verify generated YAML syntax;
- verify every Jenkins stage is accounted for;
- verify required Wave capabilities exist;
- verify repository parameters contain no known secrets;
- verify Terraform lifecycle separation;
- verify GitOps deployment boundaries;
- identify unsupported behavior;
- identify required manual configuration.

Do not claim migration success when validation fails.

## Final Agent Response

At completion, summarize:

- what was analyzed;
- what was generated;
- what was mapped;
- what requires manual configuration;
- what could not be migrated;
- validation status.

Keep the final response concise and actionable.
